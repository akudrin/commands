On MAC OS use the following to add mongo to the PATH

export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH


Before you start MongoDB for the first time, create the 
directory to which the mongod process will write data. 
By default, the mongod process uses the /data/db directory. 

mkdir -p /data/db

Get the permissions set as they should be you can run the following command

sudo chmod 0755 /data/db && sudo chown $USER /data/db

mongod - starts the server
mongo - starts the shell

db.createUser({"user": "ajitesh", "pwd": "gurukul", "roles": ["readWrite", "dbAdmin"]}) - Create users in the database; The command creates a user with username as “ajitesh” and having the role such as “readWrite” and “dbAdmin”
show users - Show users; If executed without selecting a database, it displays all users along with database information.
mongo -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD --authenticationDatabase DATABASENAME - Login into the database with username and password

db.createCollection("user") - Add a collection
