On MAC OS use the following to add mongo to the PATH

export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH


Before you start MongoDB for the first time, create the 
directory to which the mongod process will write data. 
By default, the mongod process uses the /data/db directory. 

mkdir -p /data/db



mongod - starts the server
mongo - starts the shell
